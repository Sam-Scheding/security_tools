# security_tools
Various security tools written for CTF Tournaments. These tools have usually been written
during a CTF and as such are simple and low quality. However, it should be fairly trivial
to modify them to suit simple needs.

Currently implemented tools are:

- DirBuster
- MD5 Cracker

## Installation

```
$ python3.8 -m venv env
$ source ./env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Simply modify main.py to uncomment the tool you need, and then run:

```
$ python main.py
```
